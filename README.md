# ENPM661: Project 2
# Implementation of Dijkstra algorithm for a point robot. 

## Dependencies
Python 3.7
Numpy      (For numerical computation)
Math       (For Mathematical Operations)
OpenCV     (For Visualization)

## Steps for Execution
1. Unzip the folder and in the terminal go to the folder location.
2. Run the python file with the following command :

 python <filename>.py 

Here:
<filename> -- should be the name of python file

Example Command:

~$ python3 Dijkstra-pathplanning-prateek-verma.py

Next enter values for start (x,y) and goal (x,y) positions and wait for the code to execute.

Example Inputs:

Enter start x: 10
Enter start y: 200
Enter goal x: 330
Enter goal y: 20


3. At last you will see the output: "Goal Reached!!" along with Cost to Come value for the goal position.


## Results
The output video generated as: "dijkstra_out.mp4"
